# Vue-JS-Projects

A repository for my Vue JS applications I am making throughout my SoftUni coruse on the subject.

01-vue-starter-project - A basic web page, containing an 8-Ball that answers questions with 'Yes', 'No', and 'Maybe';
03-components-and-props - A page that reacts to every click on each button independently;
